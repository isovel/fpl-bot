# Quantification of Performance Impact Considering Historical Participation in a Point-Based System

This document elucidates the algorithmic determination of a performance impact metric within a point-based system, specifically focusing on the influence of prior participation on point adjustments.

**1. Historical Participation Impact Function:**

The core computation leverages a non-linear decay function to model the diminishing impact of prior participation on current performance assessment. This function, denoted as $\text{calculateParticipationImpact}(participationCount)$, is mathematically defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{calculateParticipationImpact}(\text{participationCount}) = (1.9 \times 10^1) \times (1.4)^{-\text{participationCount}} + (1.0 \times 10^0)
\end{equation}

where:

- $\text{participationCount}$ represents the number of previous participations undertaken by a user.
- The constant $1.9 \times 10^1$ scales the initial impact magnitude.
- The base $1.4$ governs the rate of impact decay with increasing $\text{participationCount}$.
- The additive constant $1.0 \times 10^0$ ensures a non-zero asymptotic impact even with extensive prior participation.

**2. Point Differential Calculation:**

The point differential ($\text{pointDifferential}$) represents the discrepancy between a reference point total and the user's accumulated points. This is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{pointDifferential} = \text{referencePointTotal} - (\text{userPoints} \ || \ 0)
\end{equation}

where:

- $\text{referencePointTotal}$ refers to the reference point total associated with a specific identifier.
- $\text{userPoints}$ denotes the user's accumulated points.
- The logical OR operator ($||$) handles potential cases where $\text{userPoints}$ might be undefined, defaulting to zero in such scenarios.

**3. Point Adjustment Calculation:**

Finally, the point adjustment ($\text{pointAdjustment}$) resulting from the performance evaluation is calculated as a product of the normalized point differential and the participation impact:

\begin{align*}
\text{participationImpact} &= \text{calculateParticipationImpact}(\text{userParticipationCount} \ || \ 0) \\
\text{pointAdjustment} &= \frac{\text{pointDifferential}}{(2.0 \times 10^1)} \times \text{participationImpact}
\end{align*}

where:

- $\text{participationImpact}$ is derived from the $\text{calculateParticipationImpact}(x)$ function, utilizing the user's prior participation count ($\text{userParticipationCount}$) or defaulting to zero if undefined.
- The division by $2.0 \times 10^1$ normalizes the $\text{pointDifferential}$.
